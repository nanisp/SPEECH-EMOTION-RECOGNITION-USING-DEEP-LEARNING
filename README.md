# SPEECH-EMOTION-RECOGNITION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING-TECHNIQUE
This implementation of the pre-developed speech emotion recognition (SER) model is intended to analyze a speech audio input in real-time, identify and present the expressed emotion within it.

Classifying emotion from speech is a long-term problem rather than a short-term one. In Linguistics, two same phrases of speech can receive a different meaning just by emphasizing a word or even a syllable.

The model, an 96% accuracy LSTM based deep learning network, had learned how to classify the correct emotion expressed in a long-time sequence of speech features extracted from the audio signal.
